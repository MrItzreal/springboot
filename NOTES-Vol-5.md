## The `@Repository` Annotation on Spring Data JPA Interfaces

- **Rule:** In Spring Boot applications using Spring Data JPA, you **do not need** to explicitly annotate your repository interfaces with `@Repository` if they extend a core Spring Data repository interface (like `JpaRepository`, `CrudRepository`, etc.).
- **Why it's Optional:**
  - Spring Data has a built-in mechanism that runs during component scanning. It automatically detects interfaces that extend its repository base interfaces.
  - When found, Spring Data creates a proxy implementation bean for that interface at runtime and registers it in the application context. This makes the `@Repository` annotation redundant for this purpose.
- **Should You Still Use It?**
  - **Clarity:** Some developers add it for explicitness, to clearly mark the interface's role for other team members.
- **Conclusion:** You can safely omit `@Repository` from your repository interfaces for a cleaner code style.

  _Example:_

  ```java
  // The @Repository annotation is not required here.
  // @Repository
  public interface MyEntityRepository extends JpaRepository<MyEntity, Long> {
    // ... methods ...
  }
  ```
